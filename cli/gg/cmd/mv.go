git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> <destination>
git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> ... <destination directory>

In the first form, it renames <source>, which must exist and be either a file, symlink or directory, to <destination>. In the second form, the
last argument has to be an existing directory; the given sources will be moved into this directory.

The index is updated after successful completion, but the change must still be committed.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// mvCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// mvCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
